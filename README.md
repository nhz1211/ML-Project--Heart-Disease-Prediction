# Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease using various classification algorithms and patient health data.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis.

## Dataset

The project uses heart disease dataset containing patient information including:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise induced angina
- ST depression
- Slope of peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels
- Thalassemia
